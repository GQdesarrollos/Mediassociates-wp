						<h2>WHAT IS MEDIA PLANNING?</h2>
						<p>In a world where communications is being revolutionized, you need advertising specialists who understand media. For example, say you are planning a campaign to reach top executives. Business websites may charge north of $30 for 1,000 impressions ... while DSP technology costs only $3 to touch the same audience online. Making such smart decisions is at the heart of media planning, which selects the best possible communication channels to reach your specific audience at the lowest cost.</p>

						<h2>WHAT IS MEDIA BUYING?</h2>
						<p>When ad campaigns roll, someone has to order the media. But “media buying” is no longer a simple task in a world of thousands of cable channels, DVRs, websites, online video outlets, social networks, and mobile devices. Our media buyers combine knowledge of how media performs with tough rate negotiations, and we know all the hidden points in the media world that hold cost savings. You get seamless campaign execution, savings, and better results.</p>

					<h2>PRINCIPLES</h2>
					<p>Advertising works. The two key questions are to what degree, and with how much visibility? Every smart CEO asks marketing, "What is our $XX million doing for us and how do you know?"  Mediassociates answers by using powerful research to build insightful and effective media plans. We then monitor ad campaigns with ongoing performance measurement, because at least 20% of any advertising plan (even ours!) will contain underperforming media that can be redeployed for even greater results.  Insightful and innovative thinking, coupled with measurement and optimization, is how we help you answer those tough questions. With Mediassociates, you can prove that your advertising works.</p>
